                <div class="col-md-6">
                  <p>Poverty and environmental integrity are closely linked. Poor people that depend on natural resources for their livelihood would have limited opportunities if their resources are degraded. A degraded environment lowers productivity and income, thus, rendering the poor to be poorer. The deterioration of the productive capacity of natural resources is perceived as a risk that can affect poverty alleviation initiatives.</p>
                  <p>The Philippine Poverty-Environment Initiative (PPEI) supports the government, civil society and the business sector to utilize revenues and benefits from sustainable ENR management for poverty reduction and environmental protection. It aims at demonstrating that, if managed properly and sustainably, natural resources can propel the country to a path of an inclusive and sustainable development.</p>
                  <p>The PPEI operates at national and local levels, providing a better enabling environment for national and local government to ensure that ENR revenues are equitably shared by the communities and re-invested to preserve social and natural capital. It seeks to influence institutions, policies and investments to harness the potential of the country’s natural resources to achieve a greener and more inclusive development path.</p>

                  <h2>Expected Results:</h2>
                  <p>PPEI is critically designed to deliver Outcome 2 of United Nations Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) which states that “More men and women will have decent and productive employment for sustainable, inclusive and greener growth”. It also helps to achieve Millennium Development Goals 1 (Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger) and 7 (Ensure environmental sustainability).</p>
                  <p>By 2015, the following are the expected results of the project:</p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>Strengthened capacities of local communities including LGUs to access and manage assets and revenues from ENR for local economic development.</li>
                    <li>Increased budget allocation and level of spending for poverty-environment measures in lead agencies, sectoral departments and LGUs.</li>
                    <li>Improved capacity of LGUs to integrate pro-poor and environmental concerns into the design and implementation of local development plans and programs.</li>
                    <li>More efficient processes on the distribution of National Wealth (NW) between national government and LGUs through policy reforms and systems improvement.</li>
                    <li>Full public disclosure of ENR revenues collection and payment, and its utilization by LGUs.</li>
                    <li>Increased number of people gaining employment and/or venturing into productive enterprises from sustainable management of ENR, especially from resource extraction activities such as mining, oil and gas, geothermal, etc., and</li>
                    <li>More LGUs adopted green growth strategy through shift into renewable energy (RE) sources and clean development mechanisms (all LGUs with RE resources map and energy plans integrated in their Comprehensive Development Plan (CDP), and improved access of local communities to RE resources)</li>
                  </ol>
                  <h2>Rational Environment and Natural Resource Extraction and Utilization</h2>
                  <p>Some of the strongest links between poverty and environment are the industries extracting the natural wealth, such as mining, oil and gas, geothermal and hydropower plants. Extractive industries in the country refer to five investment areas: (1) mineral mining, (2) forest and secondary forest products, (3) energy resources, (4) water resources, and (5) coastal and marine resources.</p>
                  <p>To optimize the contribution of natural resources to local economic development and greener growth, an extractive industry economics must alleviate poverty by gravitating people into the enterprise with jobs, downstream economic activities, and provision of social services from the proceeds:. Natural resource revenues and benefits may be earmarked for rehabilitation of degraded ecosystem and to increase efficiencies of social services. Some of the revenues maybe used to catalyze green investments thereby generating green jobs for the general population of the community.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Resource extraction must be a positive economic enterprise bringing out natural wealth for use by the population in general, including the investor.</li>
                    <li>Extractive industries pay taxes, fees, and royalties to government. These are technically known as revenues from national wealth and are procedurally defined by laws and implementing policies. On special cases when an indigenous community is engaged because the resource is within their ancestral domain, the payment arrangement is specific.</li>
                    <li>Apart from the payments made by the industry, it is obliged to allocate part of their proceeds for social responsibility projects in the community where the resource is extracted. The industry is expected to generate jobs and propel community-level economic enterprises through the influx of hired people and their families engaging into productive undertaking. This magnetizing ability of an extractive industry could address poverty for as long as directed community preparation is equally established.</li>

                  <p>The PPEI’s main objective is to maximize the utilization of revenues and benefits derived from resource extraction activities to fund sustainable development programs that directly address the poverty situation of local communities and rehabilitate the degraded environment caused by such activities. This is being done through the following:</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Improving the policy environment and governance processes of NG-LGUs sharing of national wealth, and instituting reforms to link the revenues generated from natural resource extraction to poverty alleviation and environmental protection.</li>
                    <li>Establishing inclusive social policy that ensures equitable distribution of the benefits derived from the utilization of natural wealth.</li>
                    <li>Advocating for legislative and administrative actions to ensure irreversibility of reforms.</li>
                    <li>Developing information systems to facilitate timely and transparent release of the revenues from national wealth to LGUs, and to record and publish the LGUs shares from national wealth and their utilization.</li>
                    <li>Capacitating LGUs to integrate poverty and environment linkages in their governance regimen with climate smart and green development perspective (i.e. capacitation on identifying best development projects to be funded from national wealth; protection management of strategic sites for sustainability like water reservoir, cultural heritage areas, primary production areas; climate-proofing of LGU plans and budget; conflict negotiation, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Creating enabling conditions through providing trainings and technical support to local communities (i.e. training on payment for ecosystem services, capacitation on best land post-option analysis, etc.) and facilitating series of broad based and informed discussion that will result in the right mix of policies for the efficient management of natural resources by the government and the communities, and responsible investment by the private sector.</li>
                    <li>Building sustainability through ensuring the meaningful engagement of CSOs/NGOs/POs particularly community-based and women’s organizations and local Indigenous Peoples in local governance, and improving partnership with the private sector diversifying their social responsibility into more sustainable and productive programs/projects.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <h2>What have we accomplished so far?</h2>
                  <p>The first phase of PPEI catalysed the effort of the Government of the Philippines (GoP) and the UN system programmes to achieve foundational outputs that serve as guide for continuing concrete actions to directly link ENR management to poverty reduction. Through the project’s research and activities, PPEI progresses significantly on providing policy support on the collection, distribution and utilization of revenues from ENR for poverty reduction and environmental sustainability. In 2012, several knowledge products (policy, manual, handbook, instrument, appraisal framework, baseline information, etc.) were produced.</p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Reviewed existing procedures and practices on the computation and collection of ENR revenues and the release of the share of LGUs from National Wealth.</li>
                    <li>Reviewed budget allocation and spending for ENR concerns and advocated for increase resources for poverty alleviation and environmental protection.</li>
                    <li>Advocated for data-sharing and transparency in the collection, distribution and utilization of ENR revenues which led to the Philippines pronouncement to implement EITI.</li>
                    <li>Developed guidelines, tools and methodologies on mainstreaming poverty-environment (P-E) linkages in LGU planning, programming and budgeting system.</li>
                    <li>Conducted capacity building activities on P-E development linkage planning and management for LGUs, and valuation of mineral products for MGB personnel.</li>
                  </ul>
